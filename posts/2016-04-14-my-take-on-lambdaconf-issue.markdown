title: My Take on LambdaConf Issue
---

Does curtis yarvin have something interesting to say about programming that we can all learn from? If so, then fuck his views on women, race, politics, etc. I've read some questionable things hes said. But truth be told, what he eats doesn't make me shit. I want to continue to grow as a programmer.



besides...we can just whoop his ass after the conference if you still feel sour about him speaking. :D



just kidding.
