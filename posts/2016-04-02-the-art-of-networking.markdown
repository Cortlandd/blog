I really don't even know where I'm gonna go with this. Simply something I've been wanting to write for quite some time. 

> Warning: I REALLY suck at wording things and go off on a tangent unintentionally. 

In 7th grade I started playing Adventure Quest Worlds. I was the casual player. I did the quests, unlocked weapons, leveled up, minded my own business. So after about couple months of this, an incident happened. I was hacked. Won't go into details, but myself and the hacker became good friends after, and he introduced me to the Guardians of Doom clan. I joined and met people who are my closest friends today. Being in an envionrment of such diverse individuals, I learned a great deal about `people`. I also unintentionally got into programming. There were password crackers floating everywhere for many games and I wanted to know the insides of how they worked. The interest didn't last long. I wrote a program in VB.NET and moved on. (until junior year of high school.)

GoD now consists of about 30 individuals from economists, law students, engineers, authors, musicians, etc. A group of individuals of very useful skillsets and I'm one of them. And none of which, to my knowledge, have met eachother in real life. We simply learned at a young age, to utilize the resources around us and call on a friend in stickey situations. The leader of the clan, Lizargeco, and Ibecame good friends. So good that he is the reason I have my first bit of experience working at a startup, and the reason I decided to move forward and pursue programming. We make eachother better at the work we do. This is an individual whom I never physically met a day in my life. Someone who I've only communicated with through Facebook, Skype, and have talked to on the phone 3 times in the 6 years we've known eachother. He is a very huge influence in my life yet we've never even had a cup of coffee together. 

Example of knowing who to have on your team. A friend of mine called me at 2 a.m. because she needed a letter of recommendation to graduate at her school. I made a phone call to a very important individual to get their consent to write the individual a letter. She graduated, and now works to a very large company. You may say, "wow that's illegal you shouldn't do that", and I'd reply with a simple "fuck you". Moral of the story: utilize the resources around you, and know who to have on your team.

Well, I guess this is it as my first blog post. Sorta new to this.
